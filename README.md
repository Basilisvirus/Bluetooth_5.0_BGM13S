Bluetooth 5.1 technology (5.0 chip) BGM13S Module pcb

Me and my parthner decided to order the latest bluetooth [28 May 2019], bluetooth 5.1 chip.
Here is a video of the chip we ordered:

We made a footprint for the chip, and a schematic, using KiCad. 

The libraries i used, along with the other, custom libraries i use in KiCad, can be found here: https://github.com/Basilisvirus/VirusCad_Lib.git

We designed a pcb with all the neccesary pins and connections to make it a module/dev board.

The antenna is the only part we have not tested yet. We are unsure of its proper functionality, since it needs to be at a proper length and loop distance

Enjoy.
